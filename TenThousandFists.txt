Ten Thousand Fists
Disturbed


One more bleep bleep day when I know what I want
And my want will be considered tonight, considered tonight
Just another day when all that I want will mark me as a sinner tonight, I'm a sinner tonight

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of ten thousand fists in the air

Power un-restrained dead on the mark is what we will deliver tonight, deliver tonight
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul will make you shiver tonight, will make you shiver tonight

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of ten thousand fists in the air

We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of ten thousand fists in the air

Ten thousand fists in the air
Ten thousand fists in the air
